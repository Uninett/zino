Added new config option to post reachability event when a new device is added to show that it was discovered by Zino

We recommend to keep this config option set to `False` the first run after upgrading. That way the new `reachable_in_last_run` device status can be populated. After running Zino for a couple of minutes the config option can be set to `True` and after a restart Zino will inform about new devices that are discovered.
